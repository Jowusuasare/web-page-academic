I have a background in pure, applied, and computational mathematics, which fuels my curiosity in the experiences of mathematics education in the classroom. Being someone familiar with the “not a math-person” rhetoric, I am curious about leveraging my plethora of experiences with mathematics and technology to challenge the “not a math-person” and under-served communities to be open to the exciting opportunities understanding mathematics can bring.

I like to engage in poetry and the outdoors when I am not doing mathematics. As a first-generation student, I see the Ph.D. journey as a unique opportunity to pursue my interest in interdisciplinary research. I aspire to bridge the communication gap that exists between neophytes and experts in both the mathematics and science education community.
